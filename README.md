# Asteroids

Boot.dev asteroids project!

## Set up the project

Create the virtual environement:
`python3 -m venv venv`

Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Possible improvements
Since for now it is important for me to finish the course I will not attempt any additional improvements to the game.

In any case, when I return to this one, these are some improvements for the game suggested by boot.dev : 

Add a scoring system
Implement multiple lives and respawning
Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
Add acceleration to the player movement
Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
Add a background image
Create different weapon types
Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
Add a shield power-up
Add a speed power-up
Add bombs that can be dropped
